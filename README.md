Here is the first assignment of this series of real-time scenarios, to practice Selenium.

This assignment mainly focuses on how to invoke the Firefox browser, maximize the window, navigate commands, etc.



Note: If you are very new to selenium, go through the Environment setup for Selenium WebDriver and other articles before starting.



Scenario:

Open the Firefox browser.
Maximize the browser window.
Navigate to “http://iamneo.ai”.
Write a method to print PASS if the title of the page matches with “We are Hiring!” else FAIL. (If you are familiar with TestNG or JUnit use assert statement like assert.assertequals(actual, expected) to give a verdict of the pass or fail status.
Navigate to the Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com)
Navigate back to the iamneo.ai website.
Print the URL of the current page.
Navigate forward.
